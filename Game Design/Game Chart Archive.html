[[John Luke]]: &quot;Holy shit!&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;He calls out, realizing the massive size of the whole room. He takes a second look around realizing the miserable state the Hall was left in, cobwebs hanging all over the place and thick layers of dust covering almost every single corner of a once beautiful place.&quot;

[[John Luke]]: &quot;Well of course you would leave an insane amount of work, what was I thinking you&#39;ll once leave me something without one of your goddamn challenges or you testing how much i would conform to your stupid idea of manhood. Damm grandpa even in the end you would not a change a little bit.&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;He laughs at his own misery being alone in this huge worn out house, with no where else to go, with no idea what he will find and no idea what he will find out about his grandfather and about himself.&quot; With all of that going through his mind, he feels himself getting tired from the long time on the road and decides to look for a place to crush for the night.&quot;

Sits ontop a beside table

After turning on the lamp for the first time it can be talk to and only after that can be turned off to change its personality

Talking to the lamp reveals that the [[Flashlight]] can be found within the [[bed]] 

The lamp has seen many people coming in and out turns out your grandfather was quite the bachelor. However all of those experiences fucked with the lamps mind and split it in two. When its energized its in the present and while off its still in a past where the war was still going on and your grandfather had just finished his first sucsessfull expedition.

*look at*

[[Narrator]]: &quot;[[John Luke]] remebers this lamp well, once he fell against the small desk it sits upon and it allmost fell down. When his grandfather saw him cryomg next to the table, he did not try to calm him or ask if he was allright the only thing he cared about was if his stupid lamp was still fine and well.&quot;

*use:*
*Changes if the lamp is energized or not and therby changes his personality*

*Turning on the lamp:*
[[Narrator]]: &quot;With a bright flash the lamp starts lighting up the room. It almost seems like it woke up from a dream of a long gone past.&quot;

*Turning off the lamp:*
[[Narrator]]: &quot;With the fading lights the past seems to come back, haunting him again and agaian.&quot;

*talk to, lamp on*

[[John Luke]]: &quot;Hmm what to do ... what to do?&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;He says while thinking about his situation.
When suddendly the bedside lamps answers him.&quot;

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;Looks like your lost&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot; Suprised by the sound of another voice, [[John Luke]] jumps up almost falling flat on his face. As he realizes who is speaking with him, he calms down a litte bit and starts to thing about how to propably answer a question of a bedside lamp.&quot;

[[1. How the hell did you learn to talk? No offense but you are still a bedside lamp.-&gt;Bedside Lamp ON answer 1]]

[[2. Is this some kind of meta joke or what?-&gt;Bedside Lamp ON answer 1]]

[[3. Yeah im lost, so what? You don&#39;t really seem to fit in either. -&gt;Bedside Lamp ON answer 1]] 

*talk to, lamp off*

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;Another night another new face at your side.&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;Again a voice cuts trough the silence of this hughe place , again [[John Luke]] winces and again the lamp was the one to speak. But before Jhon can answer him again, he contiues with his one sided conversation.&quot;

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;Yes yes I know that there is still a lot to celbrate, congratulations on your most recent award by the way.

And you have all the rights to do so but don&#39;t you think it might finally be time to get working again or at least to go to bed sober for a change.

I might be a wallflower but currently you are just wasting talent here, and time and money and not to mention your health.&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;Now asking him self to whom the lamp might be talking to, [[John Luke]] decides to stay a while and listen.&quot;

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;Yeah I know that beeing an adventurer is less fun and joy than being one of the most sought after bachelors around, but damm me if it is not what you are actually ment to do with your short life.

I told you again and again that I will not recive the gift to die in peace any time time soon, it seems it is not ment to be, at least not yet. 

OK fine than, contiue to drink, fuck and drug yourself to death. But do not come bagging for forgivness when your fame starts to wear off and you need help to get back to being an explorer again.&quot;

[[Narrator]] &quot;And with that the lamp turns to being silent again. [[John Luke]] listens to silence for a few more moments before he contiues his search through the house again.&quot;

*talk to lamp on after the off dialouge*

[[John Luke]]: &quot;Do you know that you hold quiet the monolouge while turned off?&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;It almost seems like the lamp is blushing before he starts giving John his suprising anwser.&quot;

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;Well I did not think that you would notice so quickly. Well I guess I owe you at least some anwser. See I might not know what exactly I am or how excatlcy I came to be, but I do know a lot and when I say a lot I mean every memory of mine over my 150 year long life is stored somwhere in what you could call my mind. Turns out not even the mind of an concious lamp can cope with that many memories and experiences, which is why my mind cracked in half many years ago. So what you heard was the other half of my mind reliving one of my earlier memories. Maybe even one with your recently passed grandfather, your his grandchild and heir are you not?&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;Trying to follow the Lamps explenation John almost missed that the lamp knew who he were and why he was here. Trying to hide his state of confusion he says:&quot;

[[1. I am but I don&#39;t think you were talking to my grandfather back then, you talked with someone who seemed to be a famous bachelor, not my granddad.-&gt;Bedside Lamp ON p2 answer 1.1.]]

[[2. So you knew my grandfather? Any idea why he would leave me all of this?-&gt;Bedside Lamp ON p2 answer 1.1.]]

I know, it is weird for you people but you have to understand that it is even weirder for me. How am I supposed to know why I am a concious lamp or how I became one and if I knew you would propably know as well, would you not?&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;Confused by both the situation and the philosophical nature of the answer, [[John Luke]] just nods his head. After a few moments of silence he feels pressured to keep the conversation going and after a few more moments he finds an satisfactory answer.&quot;

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;Do that or not, whom is to decide but you?&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;Even more confused than before the conversation with the lamp [[John Luke]] takes his leave, asking himself if it is rude not to turn of the lamp. If he&#39;s honest though he does not really care. In the end it is still just a lamp, is it not?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Bedside Lamp ON p2 answer 1.1." tags="Cutscene Dialog" position="1682.6666666666665,830.3333333333334" size="100,100">[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;You do not seem to know a whole lot about your grandfather, let me tell you he was truly one hell of a man.&quot;

[[John Luke]]: &quot;Yeah one hell of an asshole.&quot;

[[bedside lamp]]: &quot;In the end he was thats true but see he had his reasons, reasons long forgotten even by me. After my brain split he helped me to rember some of them but I could not tell you for sure what drove him into the madness, that where his final years. What I do know however that he once  was my dearest friend and my best man at my own small wedding, which he organized. How I wish I could rember these days just me, my wife, my child and him and now look at me alone in an empty house the lone father of one child. It is rough especially when your fighting with your child all the time, you would call it puperty even though it seems to take a bit longer for us lamps.&quot;

[[Narrator]]: &quot;John listens fascinated by the stories of a grandfather he never had or at least never got to know and realizes that he starts to like the lamp even though just thinking about it sound super crazy. He also decides that if he were to find the lamp&#39;s child he would try to at talk to him and see if he could help, he always had his way with teenangers.
He contiues talking with the lamp a bit before he takes his leave, wondering where the child might be and how it might look like.&quot;</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
