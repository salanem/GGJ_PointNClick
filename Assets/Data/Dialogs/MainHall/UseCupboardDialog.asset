    m_Text: "As he tries to move the cupboard through using the extinguisher as some
      sort \nof cowbar, [[Protagonist]] muscles resign from their intended use and
      he \ndrops the extinguisher. The moment the Metal body touches the floor it
      \nbounces off off it and hits the cupboard, with its full weight. For a few
      second \nit seems like nothing would happen. Suddenly the Cupboard slowly starts
      \nfalling toward him. In the last moment he manages to step aside, only \nclosly
      avoiding the falling piece of wood."
