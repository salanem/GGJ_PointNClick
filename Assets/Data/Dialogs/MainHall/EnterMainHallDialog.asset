    m_Text: Fighting his way through this horrible storm [[John Luke]], finally approaches
      the door to his tragically acquired house. Upon entering he takes a deep breath
      and takes a look through the main hall, he finds himself in.
  - m_Speaker: John Luke
    m_Text: Holy shit!
  - m_Speaker: Narrator
    m_Text: He calls out, realizing the massive size of the whole room. He takes a
      second look around realizing the miserable state the Hall was left in, cobwebs
      hanging all over the place and thick layers of dust covering almost every single
      corner of a once beautiful place.
  - m_Speaker: John Luke
    m_Text: Well of course you would leave an insane amount of work, what was I thinking
      you'll once leave me something without one of your goddamn challenges or you
      testing how much i would conform to your stupid idea of manhood. Damm grandpa
      even in the end you would not a change a little bit.
  - m_Speaker: Narrator
    m_Text: He laughs at his own misery being alone in this huge worn out house, with
      no where else to go, with no idea what he will find and no idea what he will
      find out about his grandfather and about himself." With all of that going through
      his mind, he feels himself getting tired from the long time on the road and
      decides to look for a place to crush for the night.
