  - m_Speaker: Narrator
    m_Text: As he enters the old bedroom, pictures spring to his mind, pictures of
      a happy past. Him and his sister jumping on the bed, running through the halls,
      and his grandparents complaning about getting woken up so early.
  - m_Speaker: John Luke
    m_Text: Good times.
  - m_Speaker: Narrator
    m_Text: He says to himself. Not that he actually rembered if they were any good.
      He just needs the to be good for the moment.
